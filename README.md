# General Info

This plugin transforms a Coq goal using the specification language of the automatic prover (Bip) for projective geometry, computes a proof and then produces a trace as a Coq proof script, which is returned to Coq to be checked.

Work in progress, works with Coq 8.13.2 (May 2021).

# Scope

The prover deals with goals of the following shape :
```
Lemma ex2 : forall A B C D:Point,
    rk(A::D::B::nil) = 3 ->
    rk(A::C::D::nil) = 2 ->
    rk(C::A::nil) = 2 ->
    rk(C::D::nil) = 2 ->
    rk(A::C::B::nil) = 3.
Proof.
```
The conclusion must be of the form rk(e)=n and only variables of type Point and hypotheses of the form rk(e)=n are used. All other variables and hypotheses are ignored by the automatic prover.


# Quick start
- launching Coq in command-line mode :
```
coqtop -I src -R theories Tuto0
```
- Loading the prover infrastructure inside Coq :
```
Require Import Tuto0.Loader.
```

The  main tactic is pprove. ÃŒf no argument is given to the tactic, we
assume the dimension is 3. Alternatively, the tactic can be followed
by an integer, which specifies the dimension of the considered space.

```
pprove. (* deals with 3D goals *)

pprove 4. (* deals with 4D goals *)

## TODO
* Coq internals
  * ignore hypotheses which are not of the form rk(?e)=?v
  * replace "find_reference" with "Coqlib.lib_ref"
  * remove the call to "Vernacstate.Declare.get_current_proof_name"

* Proofs
  * make a proof of DG property which creates points interactively and use the general instance to solve the goal
